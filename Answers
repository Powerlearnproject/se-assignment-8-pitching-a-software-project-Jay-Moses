The impact and consequences of not addressing the problem.
Any existing solutions and their limitations.
Effective communication involves using data, statistics, and real-world examples to illustrate the problem and its relevance.

Solution Description:
Key elements of a solution description include:

Overview: Briefly explain how your software solves the problem.
Features: Highlight key features and functionalities.
Benefits: Describe the benefits and value proposition for users.
Differentiation: Explain how your solution is unique compared to existing ones.
Example: "Our project automates inventory management for small businesses, reducing manual errors and saving time. It includes real-time tracking, automatic reorder notifications, and customizable reports, providing businesses with accurate inventory control and cost savings."
